First make a build directory:

    mkdir build

then use cmake.

    cd build
    cmake ..
    make   # or ninja or whatever

To run, your working directory must include the shaders.

something like this:

    cd first_mandlebrot
    ../build/first_mandlebrot/first_mandlebrot

If you use Visual Studio (not tested lately, but should work) you need to set the working directory in the project settings.
