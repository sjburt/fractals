makin fractals

this is just me screwing around.

much/all of common/ is from opengl-tutorial.org. This is under the WTF licence so I presume it's OK to do WTF.

Everything in external/ is from upstream projects and retains the liscensing described therein. There are no changes.

read BUILDING.txt to build.  (hint use cmake)
